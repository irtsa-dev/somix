    <b>SOMIX</b> is a project designed for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/">Schedule I</a> by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=TVGS">TVGS</a> (also known as Tyler) to find effects and market values for certain mixtures within the game using the mixing section. One can also figure out recipes to achieve certain effects by using the reverse mixing section.

<br />

## Mixer
On the **Mixer** section, the site will display **products** and **ingredients** for you to select to build a **recipe**, displayed at the bottom.

        height=400, width=800>
</p>
<br />

You can choose a product by simply clicking on one of the listed **products**. You can then also choose an ingredient by simply clicking on one of the listed **ingredients**. As you make your selections, the site will automatically update the **recipe** and the corresponding information of your recipe such as the **effects** and **market value**.

</p>
<br />

You can remove the product or an ingredient from the **recipe** by simply clicking on it within the **recipe** as well, information will update automatically for you. Note that it will not let you add more than eight items to your recipe.

</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## Reverse Mixer
On the **Reverse Mixer** section, the site will display **products** and **effects** for you.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7e6f7e0-8cfd-4470-9310-78e595fe6cb8"
        height=400, width=800>
</p>
<br />

Here, you can select both products and effects to check, simply clicking on them will fill in the corresponding box informing you that you have selected this option. You can also click again to uncheck them. Note that you cannot select more than eight effects.

        height=400, width=800>
</p>
<br />

Once you have selected everything you wish to find, you can then hit the **find recipe** button to find a recipe that will have those effects and your selected product(s). Note that it will only display one recipe, so if you selected multiple products, it will only show the recipe it found for the left most selected product. If you select "OG Kush" and "Green Crack" for example, it will only display the recipe found for "OG Kush" unless it did not find a recipe for it, in which it will then show the one for "Green Crack" instead. If not recipe could be found, it will inform of this.
