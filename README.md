## Usage
Usage is simple, the site will display both **products**, **ingredients**, and the current **recipe** you have created so far.

</p>
<br />
<br />

You can now choose a product as your base by clicking on one of the products, the information for your **recipe** will automatically be updated for the **market value** and **effects**. The product you selected will also show up here first.

<br />
<br />

You can now choose ingredients for the recipe by clicking on them to automatically add them to the recipe. The information for your **recipe** will automatically be updated for the **market value** and **effects** just like selecting a product.

<br />
<br />

If you do not like one of the ingredients you added, you can simply click on it within the **recipe** to remove it. You can also remove the product you used this way as well, but note that information will not display unless a product is selected. You can also opt to choose a new product and it will replace the existing one. The information for your **recipe** will automatically be updated for the **market value** and **effects** as you do this.
